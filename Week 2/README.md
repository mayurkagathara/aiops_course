
# Week 2 Modules - Usage Instructions

This folder contains four main modules for Week 2. Each module has a specific purpose related to log simulation, parsing, and system metrics monitoring. Please follow the instructions below for setup and usage.

---

## 1. Simulating_log (`W02D06_simulate_logs.py`)

**Purpose:**
Simulates application log generation by creating a log file (`app.log`) with randomized log entries.


**How to Run:**

```powershell
# In the Simulating_log directory:
cd "Week 2/Simulating_log"
python W02D06_simulate_logs.py
```

**What it Does:**

- Generates a log file named `app.log` in the same directory.
- You can adjust the number of entries and interval by editing the script parameters.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x (no external packages required)

## 2. Parse_log


**Files:**

- `W02D07_parse_log.ipynb`, `W02D07_parse_log.py`, `W02D08_parse_javalog.py`, `W02D10_dashboard.py`

**Purpose:**

- Parse and analyze log files generated by the simulator or other sources.
- Visualize or extract metrics from logs.

**How to Run:**

- For Python scripts:

  ```powershell
  cd "Week 2/Parse_log"
  python <script_name.py>
  ```

- For Jupyter Notebook:

  ```powershell
  cd "Week 2/Parse_log"
  jupyter notebook W02D07_parse_log.ipynb
  ```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb`)
- May require packages like `pandas`, `matplotlib` (install with `pip install pandas matplotlib` if needed)

## 3. dashboard_psutil


**Files:**

- `metrics_collector.py`, `chart_matplotlib.py`, `system_metrics.json`

**Purpose:**

- Collects live system metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Notepad process) and visualizes them in real time.

**How to Run:**

1. **Start Metrics Collection:**

   Open a terminal in the `dashboard_psutil` directory and run:

   ```powershell
   cd "Week 2/dashboard_psutil"
   python metrics_collector.py
   ```

   This will start collecting system metrics and save them to `system_metrics.json`.

2. **Start Dashboard Visualization:**

   Open another terminal in the same directory and run:

   ```powershell
   cd "Week 2/dashboard_psutil"
   python chart_matplotlib.py
   ```

   This will open a live dashboard window visualizing the collected metrics.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- `psutil` (for metrics collection)
- `matplotlib` (for dashboard)

**Install requirements:**

```powershell
pip install psutil matplotlib
```

## 4. log and metrics


**Files:**

- `log_metrics_CLI.py`, `log_metrics_UI.py`, `app.log`

**Purpose:**

- Analyze logs and metrics via CLI or UI tools.

**How to Run:**

```powershell
cd "Week 2/log and metrics"
python log_metrics_CLI.py
# or
python log_metrics_UI.py
```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- streamlit

## General Notes

- Always ensure you are in the correct subdirectory before running scripts.
- If you encounter missing package errors, install them using `pip` as shown above.
- For Jupyter notebooks, ensure Jupyter is installed (`pip install notebook`).
- Use a virtual environment for package management if desired:

  ```powershell
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
