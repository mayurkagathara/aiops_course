## ðŸ“Š **Key Concepts in Machine Learning**

### ðŸ”¹ **Dataset**

A collection of features (input variables) and target (output variable).

### ðŸ”¹ **Feature (X)**

The input variables used to predict the target.

### ðŸ”¹ **Target (y)**

The output variable we are trying to predict (classification or regression).

### ðŸ”¹ **Train-Test Split**

Dividing the dataset into **training data** (to train the model) and **test data** (to evaluate performance).

### ðŸ”¹ **Stratified Train-Test Split**

Ensures that the proportion of classes in training and test sets remains the same as the original dataset.

### ðŸ”¹ **Cross-Validation (CV)**

Splits the dataset into multiple folds for training and validation to get more reliable performance estimates.

### ðŸ”¹ **KFold**

Cross-validation method that splits the data into K equally sized folds.

### ðŸ”¹ **StratifiedKFold**

A variant of KFold for classification problems that preserves class proportions in each fold.

## ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning Algorithms Used**

### ðŸ”¹ **Logistic Regression**

A simple classification algorithm that predicts the probability of classes using a logistic (sigmoid) function.

### ðŸ”¹ **Random Forest**

An ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for better accuracy.

### ðŸ”¹ **Linear Regression**

A regression algorithm that fits a straight line to predict continuous values.

### ðŸ”¹ **Ridge Regression**

A variant of linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting.

### ðŸ”¹ **KMeans Clustering**

An unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into **k clusters** by minimizing intra-cluster distance.

### ðŸ”¹ **Agglomerative Clustering**

A hierarchical clustering algorithm that merges clusters iteratively based on similarity.

### ðŸ”¹ **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**

A dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while preserving variance.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Metrics Used**

### ðŸ”¹ **Accuracy**

Percentage of correctly predicted samples:
$$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Samples}} $$

### ðŸ”¹ **Precision**

Out of all predicted positives, how many are correct:
$$ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP} $$

### ðŸ”¹ **Recall (Sensitivity)**

Out of all actual positives, how many are correctly predicted:
$$ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP+FN} $$

### ðŸ”¹ **F1-Score**

Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:
$$ F1 = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall} $$

### ðŸ”¹ **ROC-AUC Score**

Measures how well the model separates classes by plotting True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate.

### ðŸ”¹ **RÂ² Score**

Explains how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.

### ðŸ”¹ **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors:
$$ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum(y_{true} - y_{pred})^2} $$

### ðŸ”¹ **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

Average of absolute errors:
$$ MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum|y_{true} - y_{pred}| $$

### ðŸ”¹ **Silhouette Score**

Measures how well samples are clustered:

- Close to **1** â†’ good clustering
- Close to **0** â†’ overlapping clusters

### ðŸ”¹ **Inertia (Elbow Method)**

Sum of squared distances of samples to their nearest cluster center. Used to find optimal number of clusters.

### ðŸ”¹ **numpy** â†’ Numerical operations

### ðŸ”¹ **matplotlib / seaborn** â†’ Visualization

### ðŸ”¹ **scikit-learn (sklearn)** â†’ ML algorithms, datasets, metrics, model selection utilities
